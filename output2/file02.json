Introduction to the Foundation Level Extensions \nThis  overview  document  is  intended  for  anyone  with  an  interest  in  the  ISTQB  Foundation  Level \nExtensions who wants a high-level introduction to the leading principles and an overview of the individual \nextension syllabi. \nFrom  time  to  time,  ISTQB  will  update  this  document  to  reflect  any  additional  extensions  that  shall  be \nintroduced  for  the  Foundation  Level,  or  to  reflect  major  changes  in  existing  ones.  Publications  of  the \nupdated document will be available on the ISTQB website. \nThe ISTQB Foundation and Advanced Level syllabi have been defined and have been on the market for \nsome  time.  New  topics  emerge  due  to  technology  and  methodology  changes  in  the  market  which  often \nare brought into the ISTQB program as new Expert Level syllabi. However, not all topics are suited for the \nExpert Level.  For this reason, the extension syllabi are established at the Foundation Level to expand the \nISTQB  program  to  incorporate  new  or  updated  knowledge.  New  extensions  shall  be  discussed  and \nintroduced by the ISTQB periodically. Extensions may be established at the Advanced Level  as well, but \nthat is beyond the scope of this document. \nThe following Foundation Level Extension syllabus has been released: \n  Agile Tester \nIn this document, each Foundation Level Extension syllabus is summarized and the associated Business \nOutcomes are stated.  The Business Outcomes communicate what can be expected from a person who \nachieves  a  Foundation  Level  Extension Certification in a particular subject  area  (e.g.,  Agile Tester),  and \nwill outline the benefits for companies that are considering the development of specific testing skills at this \nlevel. \nVersion 2014 \nPage 6 of 12 \nMay 31, 2014 \n© International Software Testing Qualifications Board \n"

Introduction to Foundation Level Agile Tester Extension \nThe  certification  for  Foundation  Level  Extension  –  Agile  Tester  is  designed  for  professionals  who  are \nworking  within  Agile  environments. \nIt  is  also  for  professionals  who  are  planning  to  start  implementing \nAgile  methods  in  the  near  future,  or  are  working  within  companies  that  plan  to  do  so,  The  certification \nprovides an advantage for those who would like to know the required Agile activities, roles, methods, and \nmethodologies specific to their role. \n2.1  Intended Audience \nThe Foundation Level Extension – Agile Tester qualification is aimed at four main groups of professionals: \n1.  Professionals  who  have  achieved  in-depth  testing  experience  in  traditional  methods  and  would \nlike to get an Agile Tester Certificate. \n2.  Junior  professional  testers  who  are  just  starting  in  the  testing  profession,  have  received  the \nFoundation  Level  certificate,  and  would  like  to  know  more  about  the  tester’s  role  in  an  Agile \nenvironment. \n3.  Professionals  who  are  relatively  new  to  testing  and  are  required  to  implement  test  approaches, \nmethods and techniques in their day to day job in Agile projects. \n4.  Professionals  who  are  experienced  in  their  role  (including  unit  testing)  and  need  more \nunderstanding  and  knowledge  about  how  to  perform  and  manage  testing  on  all  levels  in  Agile \nprojects. \nThese  professionals  include  people  who  are  in  roles  such  as  testers,  test  analysts,  test  engineers,  test \nconsultants, test managers, user acceptance testers, and software developers. \nThis  Foundation  Level  Extension  –  Agile  Tester  certification  may  also  be  appropriate  for  anyone  who \nwants  a  deeper  understanding  of  software  testing  in  the  Agile  world,  such  as  project  managers,  quality \nmanagers,  software  development  managers,  business  analysts, \nIT  directors,  and  management \nconsultants. \n2.2  Career Paths for Testers \nBuilding  on  the  Foundation  Level,  the  Agile  Tester  Extension  supports  the  definition  of  career  paths  for \nprofessional testers.  A person with the Agile Tester  certificate has extended the broad understanding of \ntesting acquired at the Foundation Level to enable him or her to work effectively as a professional tester in \nan Agile project.  \nPeople possessing an ISTQB Foundation Level Extension – Agile Tester certificate may use the Certified \nTester Foundation Level acronym CTFL-AT. \n2.3  Learning Objectives \nIn  general,  the  Foundation  Level syllabus  is  examinable  at  a  K1  level,  i.e.,  the candidate  will  recognize, \nremember and recall terms and concepts stated in the Foundation Level syllabus. \nIn  addition,  all  Foundation  Level  syllabus  learning  objectives  are  examinable  at  the  same  K- level  in  an \nextension exam. \nVersion 2014 \nPage 7 of 12 \nMay 31, 2014 \n© International Software Testing Qualifications Board \n"
