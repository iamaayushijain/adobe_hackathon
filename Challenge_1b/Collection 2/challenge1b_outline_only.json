When you open a\n          scanned document, Acrobat automatically runs OCR in the background to make the\n          document editable. Before editing, review the document to ensure that the content is\n          accurate and complete. If necessary, rescan the document using the Scan & OCR > Recognize\n                                                                                    \n          Text tool to improve the output.                                          \n                                                                                    \n          Enhance image quality. If the scanned PDF contains low-quality images, use the Enhance\n          scanned file or Enhance camera image feature to improve the quality of images before\n          attempting to edit the document.

The original\n          file is not modified. Instead, Acrobat creates an autosave file of changes, which includes all the\n          changes you made to the open file since the last automatic save. The amount of new\n          information that the autosave file contains depends on how frequently Acrobat saves the\n                                                                                    \n          autosave file. If you set the autosave interval to 15 minutes, you could lose the last 14 minutes\n          of your work if a problem occurs. Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is\n          especially useful if you make extensive changes to a document, such as by adding comments.\n                                                                                    \n          You can apply autosave changes to the original files when you restart Acrobat. When you\n          close, save manually, or revert to the last-saved version of a file, the autosave file is deleted.\n          Note:                                                                     \n                                                                                    \n          If you use assistive technology, such as a screen reader, you may want to disable the Autosave\n          feature so that you don’t lose your place when the file is reloaded.      \n                                                                                    \n          The Autosave feature won’t work in the following cases:                   \n                                                                                    \n            •  A document that has its security changed.

The digital ID contains a private key and a\n          certificate with a public key, and more.

The timestamp\n          capability and native support for long-term validation of signatures (introduced in Acrobat\n          9.1) is in compliance with Part 4 of the PAdES standard. The default signing format, when set\n          up accordingly, is compliant with Part 2 of the PAdES standard. You can change the default\n          signing method or format, in the Signatures panel of the Preferences dialog box.

After you locate a\n          certificate, you can add it to your list of trusted identities so that you don’t have to look it up\n          again. By developing a storage area for trusted certificates, you or a member of your\n          workgroup can facilitate the use of encryption in the workgroup.          \n                                                                                    \n          For more information about directory servers, see the Digital Signature Guide.\n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n          Import  directory server settings (Windows   only)                        \n                                                                                    \n          You import directory server settings using security import/export methodology or a security\n                                                                                    \n          settings file.

Depending on how you’ve configured your application,\n          validation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the\n          authenticity of the signature’s digital ID certificate status and document integrity.\n                                                                                    \n          To verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are\n          trusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or\n          Acrobat Reader settings.                                                  \n                                                                                    \n          To verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after\n          signing. If changes were made, the verification ensures that the signer allowed the changes.\n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    "

In contrast, XML signatures only have two data verification\n          states, valid and invalid. The invalid state is called when a user alters the XML-signed content.\n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n          Establish long-term  signature  validation                                \n                                                                                    \n          Long-term signature validation allows you to verify the signature's validity long after the\n                                                                                    \n          document was signed. To achieve this, all the necessary elements for signature validation\n          must be embedded in the signed PDF. These elements can be embedded during the\n          document signing process or added afterward.                              \n                                                                                    \n          If certain information is not included in the PDF, the signature can only be validated for a\n          limited time because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked.\n          When a certificate expires, the issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing\n          revocation status, rendering the signature unverifiable.                  \n                                                                                    \n          The necessary elements for signature validity include the signing certificate chain, certificate\n          revocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If these elements are embedded during signing,\n          the signature can be validated without requiring external resources.      \n                                                                                    \n          Acrobat and Acrobat Reader can embed the necessary elements if available, and the PDF\n          creator must enable usage rights for Acrobat Reader users by going to the hamburger\n          menu (Windows) or the Acrobat menu (macOS) > Save as other > Acrobat Reader\n          extended PDF.                                                             \n                                                                                    \n          Note: Embedding timestamp information requires an appropriately configured timestamp\n          server. In addition, the signature validation time must be set to Secure Time by navigating\n          to Preferences > Security > Advanced Preferences > Verification tab.      \n                                                                                    \n          CDS certificates can add verification information, such as revocation and timestamp into the\n          document without requiring any configuration from the signer.

A text box remains visible on the document\n          page; it doesn’t close like a pop-up note.                                \n          Text font and size are based on the system's default settings.            \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n               Note:                                                                \n                                                                                    \n               You can add comments to Japanese, Chinese, and Korean text with the Text Box tool,\n               but you must have the Asian-language resource files installed. Text boxes allow for\n               horizontal text only.                                                \n                                                                                    \n          You can use the Text callout tool to create a callout text box. Callout text boxes are handy\n          when you want to single out—but not obscure—a particular area of a document. Callout text\n                                                                                    \n          boxes have three parts: a text box, a knee line, and an end-point line. You can resize each part\n          by dragging a handle. The knee line can be resized in one direction only; horizontal knee lines\n          can be resized horizontally only; vertical knee lines can be resized vertically only. The text box\n          expands vertically as you type so that all text remains visible.          \n                                                                                    \n          You can move the text box itself or together with the end-point line. The text box moves\n          around a stationary anchor point—the arrow on the end-point line—created when you first\n          click in the PDF. You can modify the color and appearance of the text box and add arrows or\n          leaders to the end-point line.                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                                                                    \n          Add a comment   in text box                                               \n                                                                                    \n            1.
